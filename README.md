this repository is notes from Object-Oriented-Programming learning video.

## Opject Oriented Programming
> is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of > attributes and methods. [from Gartner.com](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/oop-object-oriented-programming)
### OOP follows four principles:

#### 1. Encapsulation 
Like a medical pill you can use it whenever you want and the pill might change
without affecting anything. Also, it protects attributes and methods from unwanted changes
and prevents 'ripple effect' from ruining the entire code when changes are made

#### 2. Polymorphism 
The ability of one function to perform in different ways. Applied in two ways:
- Overloading: Multiple methods with same name but with different parameters
-  Overriding: overrides methods in parent class which means that child class (inherited from parent)
 uses the same method in different way

#### 3. inheritance
Using the same attributes as the parent class without repeating codes
and adding attributes that applies only to that object

#### 4. Abstraction
Simplifying and hiding complexity (of implementation) behind the interface (communication) 

Example: using Coffee machine with buttons without knowing how it works
